    <p>Dear Neqtr Tribe,</p>

    <p>Breakups are hard, and we’ve got all the feels...</p>

    <p>Neqtr was born out of a vision of inspiring people to give back and in turn find quality partners to share the experience
      with. It was developed by activists for change, humanitarians, and tech-savvy millennials as a platform that incentivizes
      making the world a better place, together. We wholeheartedly believe that giving back is sexy, and part of our mission
      is to help redefine sexy for good. It still is.</p>

    <p>Sadly, Neqtr was not the vehicle for realizing that vision, and thus we made the tough decision to close our doors.</p>

    <p>We deeply appreciate each and every one of you that took a chance on us, spread the love about the app, and believed
      in our vision. We love you and we want you to know you inspire us to do better. We’re still fulfilling the mission
      and vision in our own actions and other projects. We hope you will find someone to save the world with, find personal
      fulfillment in your life, and take a stand for causes important to you. It only takes one person to change the world
      and the life of another.</p>

    <p>Peace, Love, &amp; Gratitude,
      <br />Sonya, Amy, and Wolf</p>

    <p>P.S. This will take effect at the end of January 31st, 2018.</p>
